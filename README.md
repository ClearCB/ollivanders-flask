# Ollivanders flask

Start statment that our teacher dfleta prepared to us: [statement](https://github.com/dfleta/ollivanders_shop). And his [solution](https://github.com/dfleta/ollivanders). All the documentation he gave to us [here](https://github.com/dfleta/flask-rest-ci-boilerplate)

Also there will be my solution of the [refactoring kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/python) of Emily Bache. [My solution](https://github.com/ClearCB/gildedrose-kata/tree/main/python) of the previous kata without using an API REST.

The exercise that will be stored in this repository, will have the same statment but I wll create a "web" in which there will be an API REST additional at the solution.

## Domain

This application is a simulation of a magic store called "Gilded Rose" which have an specific inventory whose items have magicals behaviour. Each of them update their quality in a different way. The initial inventory stock was:

* Normal Items
* Sulfuras
* Aged Brie
* Backstage

And the kata is planned to create an application to keep SOLID principles, so we can add a new item category and keep working well (OCP principle). Since we have to add a new item called "conjured", the exercise consist in creating a logical architecture in which all the items correclty updates the quality.  

To understand the working application is important you to read the following documents: [application requierments](./doc/OriginalRequirements.txt) and [quality items behaviour](./doc/qualityBehaviour.txt)
