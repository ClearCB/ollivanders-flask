At this file we will keep update the "behaviour" of each category existing in the GildedRose shop. 
Each product has a "name", a "sell-in" date and a "quality" that describe each product.

First we will introduce each type of product they offer:

- Normal Items
- Aged Brie
- Backstage
- Sulfuras

Last introduction:

- Conjured

The problem is that the quality update behaviour of each product is diferent, so we will make a list
on how it works.

Common
------

All the items at the shop, has a common constraint about the quality:

The quality is always greater or equal than 0 and lower than 50.

------------
Normal Items
------------

The quality of Normal Items degrade 1 per day passed till the sell-in date arrives. Once this date arrives
the quality starts degrading twice fast as normal.

---------
Aged Brie
---------

The quality of Aged Brie items increases the quality in a reverse ways than the NormalItem does.

The longer the sell_in date is close, the more quality the item gets

Increases 1 till the sell-in date arrives, and then it start upgrading its quality per 2. 

------------------------
Sulfuras, legendary item
------------------------

The sulfuras item is a little bit special, since it is legendary...it wont even be sold and 
its quality will never be diferent than 80.

---------
Backstage
---------

The backstage item quality update will depend on the sell in date, the closest it is the more quality it has the item.

If the sell in date is 10 or less, the quality will increase by 2. If the sell-in date is 5 or less it increases by 3
if the sell in data is 0, the quality drops to 0

--------
Conjured
--------

The conjured item, decreases its quality twice as fast as normal items. per 2 if sell in did not arrived
Per 4 if it already passed
